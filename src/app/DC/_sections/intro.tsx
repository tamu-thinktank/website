          Our clubâ€™s mission is to provide experience and opportunities to all engineering students, regardless of their prior experiences. Please keep this in mind as you complete your application.

          <br /> <br />


          The MATE ROV challenge is a hands-on engineering competition where students design, build, and operate underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles) to complete tasks. These tasks simulate real-world challenges faced by professionals in industries like ocean exploration, marine science, and the management of offshore energy. Students applying to the team are expected to bring commitment, creativity, and a collaborative spirit. To learn more, please visit the MATE ROV Competition Website.

          There are 2 multiple-choice sections and 1 open-ended question section with a resume upload at the end. We recommend writing your free responses in a separate document and transferring them to the application. Additionally, we recommend having your resume downloaded on your device before continuing.
          <br /> <br />
          Please note: Applications with missing or incomplete responses will be automatically rejected. We encourage you to take your time and thoroughly fill out the application. ThinkTank reserves the right to vary evaluation criteria each recruitment cycle based on number of applications, available team positions, and other relevant factors.
